# README

THIS SCRIPT starts from a folder containing BEAST STDOUT files with extension ".out" from one run, or from multiple runs in the case of model comparison (e.g. output files from multiple *BEAST species tree runs that you want to compare using the Bayes factor delimitation, BFD, procedure of Grummer et al. 2014). This code extracts path sampling (PS) and stepping-stone sampling (SS) results from the final sections of the output files and organizes them into a summary table file.

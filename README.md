# RAD-phylo-geo
shell scripts for processing and analyzing RAD (or other SNP/GBS) data for phylogenomics &amp; next-gen phylogeography

INTRODUCTION
-------

RAD-phylo-geo is a repository for shell scripts and code I am developing and using in pipelines to analyze ddRAD-seq data for on-going projects in the lab. Currently, the repository contains code related to, or linking, the following software:
- pyRAD
- PartitionFinder
- fastSTRUCTURE

However, I have other code for working with SNP data in *BEAST, ExaBayes, and G-PhoCS, and I am also currently developing parts of this pipeline to help conduct analyses of SNP loci in SNAPP and Migrate-N. So, stay tuned... as this will be coming out in the coming weeks and months, alongside refinements to the existing code (first draft of the set).
